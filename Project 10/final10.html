<p>The dilemma I have chosen involves people illegally downloading music over the internet. I choose to download some music over the internet once in a  while because listening to music from Youtube uses 2.5-6MB per minute and legally purchasing music can be expensive.<br>I download music off the internet because:

<ul>

<li>It's free</li>
<li>Incredibly convenient</li>
<li>Purchasing legal copies can be expensive</li>

</ul>

The problem with downloading music over the internet is:

<ul>

<li>A virus could be downloaded</li>
<li>It is copyright infringement and the fines can go up to $250,000, if caught</li>
<li>Spyware could be downloaded</li>

</ul>

<p>In conclusion, I will not download music illegally over the internet as often as I used to because of the potential problems it could create.
