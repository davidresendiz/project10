<p>Hello, my name is David and I am fourteen years old. My free time is mostly spent playing videogames on my Playstation 4. I primarily play Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege and Overwatch. I created this website using HTML for the layout and CSS to style the website.

<p>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first person tactical shooter that involves 30 operators (subject to change with new downloadable content) that has one team attack, while the other defends in 3 gamemodes. The 3 gamemodes are Secure the Area, Bomb, which involves the attacking team planting a defuser, and Hostage(Rescue the Hostage and extract him/her). The 3 main pillars that the game features are teamwork, tactics, and tension.

<h2>What is HTML and CSS?</h2>

<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which is a standardized system for tagging text files. The current version of HTML and the type I used is HTML5.

<p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document.
